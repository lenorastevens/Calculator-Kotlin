# Overview

This has been a projected created during the process of learning how to code in the Kotlin language.  I created a calculator app with just the very basic functions.  The app takes in a number, an operation, and a 2nd number and then performs the operation and outputs a result.   

I choose to use Android Studio and write this program because I was looking for a project that would be more fun and visible than a simple console program.  It was fun to write.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- My app is very simple.  I could spend more time working on adding more complicated mathmatical options.
- My app is limited in decimal space.  It can be buggy when the decimals get too long. I need to understand more about displaying the numbers to handle this.
- My app is not hosted or specifically available. I started looking, but have just ran out of time.  I would like to learn how to make this available to load on an actual mobile device.
